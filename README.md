# lyto-bot

## Introduction

> This script is solely made for educational use for learning `pyautogui`.

This is a little bot which automatically plays the Facebook game *[Lyto Different Color!] (https://fb.gg/play/lytodifferentcolor)*

The main principle is to recognize the minority color in the game window and click on it.

The bot is done by using the Python package of auto-controlling `pyautogui` and image processing `pillow`



## How to run

- Run the script bot.py 

- Adjust the position of the game window relative to your screen.
  - May have to re-specify `AREA` 
- To abort the bot, move the cursor to any of the corner to trigger termination of bot
